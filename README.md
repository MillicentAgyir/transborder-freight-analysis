# TransBorder Freight Data Analysis

This project explores freight transportation data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to identify inefficiencies, patterns, and environmental impacts across various transportation modes.

## Tools Used

- **Python** – Data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning and wrangling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Exploratory data visualization
- **Plotly** – Interactive visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and code documentation

## Business Goals
- Understand freight movement patterns
- Identify operational inefficiencies
- Evaluate environmental impacts
- Analyze safety incidents
- Investigate economic disruptions
- Provide data-driven recommendations

## Analytical Questions (Based on Business Goals)

 1. Uncover Freight Movement Patterns : Explore how, what, where, and when freight is transported.

1.1. What are the yearly and monthly trends in freight volume across road, rail, air, and water?

1.2. Which transportation modes are most dominant in specific regions or states?

1.3. How does the distribution of freight volume vary by commodity type over time and mode?

1.4. Which origin-destination (OD) pairs or corridors have the highest freight movement, and how have they changed over time?

2. Identify Operational Inefficiencies : Discover where resources are under- or over-utilized.

2.1. Which ports or entry points have the highest delays relative to freight volume?

2.2. Are there modes or regions where capacity appears underutilized despite high demand elsewhere?

2.3. How does freight flow correlate with known infrastructure bottlenecks or maintenance schedules?

2.4. Do certain transport modes consistently underperform in terms of delivery time or throughput efficiency?

3. Analyze Environmental Impact : Assess sustainability across freight systems.

3.1. Which transportation modes are associated with the highest fuel usage and CO₂ emissions?

3.2. How has the environmental impact of each mode changed over time?

3.3. Which regions or routes show the worst emissions-to-tonnage ratios?

3.4. What opportunities exist for mode-shifting (e.g., road to rail) to reduce emissions?

4. Safety and Risk Assessment: Understand incident patterns and safety risks.

4.1. Which transportation modes have the highest frequency of safety incidents or accidents?

4.2. Are there seasonal or temporal patterns in freight-related safety incidents?

4.3. What are the most common causes of safety incidents across different transport modes?

4.4. Do high-volume routes correlate with a higher rate of safety incidents?

5. Analyze Economic Disruptions: Examine how external factors affect freight.

5.1. How did major events like COVID-19 or trade policy changes impact freight volumes and modal shares?

5.2. Which commodities or regions were most affected by international disruptions or tariffs?

5.3. Is there a correlation between fuel price fluctuations and modal freight distribution?

5.4. How have freight costs and volumes changed before, during, and after significant economic events?

6. Provide Data-Driven Recommendations: Summarize insights to guide improvements.

6.1. What infrastructure investments should be prioritized based on freight volume and congestion?

6.2. Which modes or corridors can be optimized for better environmental and economic performance?

6.3. What policy interventions could reduce safety incidents and improve cross-border logistics?

6.4. How can BTS support sustainable growth in underutilized transport corridors or ports?
